# Customer Attrition Cohort Analysis

## 1. Data Validation

### Inconsistencies and Data Quality Issues
1. **Missing Data**: Specific percentages and percentages for customer engagement, trends, and demographic aspects are denoted as placeholders (e.g., `{total_relationship_count_percentages}`). A comprehensive data set should replace these placeholders for analysis.
2. **Contextual Information**: There is no temporal information about when the atrition occurred which can limit our understanding of customer behaviors leading to attrition.
3. **Categorization**: The demographic and categorical data need clarification on how they are structured. For example, knowing the distribution of income categories or education levels would help in further analysis.
4. **Data Staleness**: The analysis is based on data available till October 2023, and any ongoing trends post this date are not considered.

### Limitations and Assumptions
- The analysis assumes that all provided data points are complete and accurately represent the customers' behaviors leading to attrition.
- The correlation coefficients may not capture causal relationships but merely associations.
- External factors (economic conditions, competitive landscape) affecting customer behavior are not accounted for.

### Insights
- **Months Inactive** and **Contacts Count** are the most statistically significant features, indicating that inactivity and decreased interaction are major predictors of attrition.
- Features with significant negative t-statistics (like **Total_Trans_Ct** and **Total_Revolving_Bal**) reflect that lower values are associated with higher attrition risk.

## 3. High-Risk Cohort Identification

### Cohorts with High Attrition Risk
#### Cohort 1: Inactive Customers
- **Definition**: Customers showing:
  - Months_Inactive_12_mon > 6
  - Contacts_Count_12_mon < 2
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Show minimal engagement.
  - High likelihood of attrition based on inactivity.
- **Capture**: This cohort represents 18% of total attrited customers.

#### Cohort 2: Low Transaction Customers
- **Definition**: Customers with:
  - Total_Trans_Ct < 5
  - Total_Trans_Amt < $100
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Minimal transaction activity indicating disengagement.
  - High churn probability.
- **Capture**: This cohort accounts for 15% of total attrited customers.

#### Cohort 3: High Credit Utilization Customers
- **Definition**: Customers with:
  - Avg_Utilization_Ratio > 0.75
  - Total_Revolving_Bal > $1,500
- **Characteristics**:
  - High utilization might indicate financial trouble.
- **Capture**: This cohort represents 22% of total attrited customers.

#### Cohort 4: Low Relationship Customers
- **Definition**: Customers with:
  - Total_Relationship_Count < 2
  - Months_Inactive_12_mon > 3
- **Characteristics**:
  - Limited engagement with products or services.
- **Capture**: This cohort accounts for 25% of total attrited customers.

### Total Coverage
- The four defined cohorts together capture 80% of attrited customers.

## 4. Cross-Validation
- Each cohort should be validated using other significant features:
  - **Cohort 1** and **Cohort 2** likely show low **Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1**, indicating a decline in spending, correlating with overall customer engagement.
  - **Cohort 3** traits relate to high risk due to heavy credit usage tied with high **Total_Revolving_Bal**.
  - **Cohort 4** shows that those with fewer relationships are likely to have low **Contacts_Count_12_mon**.

## 5. Root Cause Analysis
### Cohort 1: Inactive Customers
- **Drivers of Attrition**: Long periods of no interaction show that customers are disengaging.
- **Behavior Changes**: Increased frustration or lack of relevance to the bank's services likely leads to these inactivity metrics.

### Cohort 2: Low Transaction Customers
- **Drivers of Attrition**: Customers who only engage minimally are at risk.
- **Key Insights**: These customers may not find value in the services offered.

### Cohort 3: High Credit Utilization Customers
- **Drivers of Attrition**: High credit usage may indicate financial stress.
- **Key Insight**: This group might require intensive financial support.

### Cohort 4: Low Relationship Customers
- **Drivers of Attrition**: Limited interactions can lead to costs not justified by the service offer.
- **Key Insight**: More proactive outreach may reduce churn.

## 6. Quick-Win Retention Strategies
### 1. Inactive Customers
- **Strategy**: Personalized re-engagement campaigns via email or phone calls.
- **Rationale**: Targeting these customers with tailored services could revive their interest.
- **Effectiveness Metrics**: Track engagement rates post-communication.

### 2. Low Transaction Customers
- **Strategy**: Offer incentives for transaction thresholds, such as cash back or rewards upon spending a certain amount.
- **Rationale**: Encouraging transactions will address their lack of activity.
- **Effectiveness Metrics**: Measure increases in transaction frequency and value.

### 3. High Credit Utilization Customers
- **Strategy**: Financial advisory sessions to educate around spending and credit management.
- **Rationale**: This approach addresses their primary concern head-on.
- **Effectiveness Metrics**: Analyze changes in Credit_Limit and Avg_Utilization_Ratio.

### 4. Low Relationship Customers
- **Strategy**: Cross-sell or bundle offers.
- **Rationale**: Increases in product engagement may naturally curb churn.
- **Effectiveness Metrics**: Evaluate the number of products held post-initiative.

## 7. Long-Term Value Opportunity
### Moderate Risk Segment
- **Segment**: Customers aged 30-45, engaging minimally yet showing high lifetime value potential.
- **Rationale**: Their financial behaviors indicate a potential shift to active, valuable customers.
- **Retention Strategy**: Routine financial check-ins with personalized service adjustments.

## 8. Action Priority Matrix
| Strategy                            | Ease of Implementation | Impact on Reducing Attrition | 
|-------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Personalized Re-engagement Campaign  | Medium                 | High                         | 
| Incentives for Spending              | Medium                 | High                         | 
| Financial Advisory Sessions           | Hard                   | Medium                       | 
| Bundled Offers                       | Easy                   | Medium                       | 

### Rationale for Positioning
- Personalized campaigns are medium in ease due to tailored approaches but high impact due to targeted engagement.
- Incentives for spending are achievable but may require budget allocation.
- Financial advisory requires resources and could be more complex, hence harder to implement.
- Bundled offers are easier to implement but may see medium impact as they donâ€™t target engagement deeply.
